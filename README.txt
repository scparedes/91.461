The following contains the comments I submitted to each assignment.

Assignment 2:
I've worked extensively with bootstrap before -- it's my favorite  web developing framework.  Much of my index page is inspired by simple bootstrap structures that I've used in the past.  However, color/font/background configurations were not taken from these templates.  I took the time to coordinate those properties myself.

A word on CSS validation...
Certain color arrangements for the navbar and other buttons were generated by online tools that I referenced in my code.  They allow for quick configurations of all the colors a developer would like to use in the navbar and in buttons.  You'll find that virtually all of the css that does not validate in custom.css belongs to those online generated colors/fades/transitions.
There are also complaints coming from the webkit/moz/o transition-ers and background descriptors.  I don't think the use of these tools in my css will cause any major/minor issues in your testing.

Assignment 3:
Similar to my last submission, my index page is inspired by simple bootstrap structures that I've used in the past.  In fact, the html for this assignment virtually didn't change at all from the last assignment.  However, this index page now has a link to assignment 3.  It is here that you will find assignment 3 -- a total restyling of the index rendition through a completely separate css file, called black.css.  I used a simple javascript function called swapStyleSheet in change-css.js to change the styling of the index page without having to change the structure of my index page.  
Note: If you click on Assignment 1 and 2 again, the original stylesheet will re-swap with the alternate stylesheet.

A word on CSS validation...
Same deal as my last submission.  Certain color arrangements for the navbar and other buttons were generated by online tools that I referenced in my code.  They allow for quick configurations of all the colors a developer would like to use in the navbar and in buttons.  You'll find that virtually all of the css that does not validate in black.css belongs to those online generated colors/fades/transitions.
